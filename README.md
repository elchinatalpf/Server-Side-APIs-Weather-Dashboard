# Server-Side-APIs-Weather-Dashboard
![](./assets/Weather%20Dashboard%20Screenshot.png)

This project is about searching for any city in the world. The OpenWeather APIs provide an easy way to access and check a good amount of data about that city. It can be configured to show, almost, whatever we want. In the case of this project, we will see the name of the city with its current day, the temperature, wind, and humidity. It will also show five days forecast to see future weather conditions. In the project are being used two third party APIs, Dayjs and OpenWeather. The cities searched will remained visible until the "reset" button is clicked.

## Tasks Achieved
* After user input a search for a city appears and is added to the search history
* The current weather condition can be seen for that city
